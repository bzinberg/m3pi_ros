\f0\fs24 \cf0 m3pi tutorial  (Polish this when \
\
My goal was to obtain a small, cheap robot that I could control wirelessly and easily integrate into ROS. Pololu's m3pi + wixel wound up being perfect for this. \
\
\
Required parts:\
m3pi robot - http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2151\
2xwixel + USB cable - http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1338\
download of the "pololu wixel configuration utility" - http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J46/all#3.c\
download of the "wireless serial app" - http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J46/all#9.b\
ability & tools to solder\
\
Steps:\
1) Solder the wixel headers onto the m3pi expansion board, plug in wixel\
2) attach 3 jumpers\
3) load the wireless serial program onto the wixels; use default parameters, other than setting the baud rate to 115200, and the serial_mode to 1 for the computer's wixel, and to 2 for the robot's wixel. See [4] for a full tutorial on this.\
\
Operation:\
1) Plug robot's wixel into the board, turn on robot (it comes pre-loaded with a suitable demo program)\
2) plug wixel#2 into computer, note what serial port it comes up as (on a mac, it'll be something like '/dev/cu.usbmodem1234'\
3) run 'python wixel_cmdline.py serial_port'\
4) type in desired velocity commands. Format is: linear (m/s), angular (rad/s)\
\
Notes:\
* The example code here does not even come close to exposing all of the 3pi's functionality. It has built-in line following, speakers, and small display\
* Technically, you don't even need the full m3pi expansion board - all that matters is that you power the wixel and connect it's tx/rx lines to sd0/sd1 on the 3pi base. I went with the expansion as the closest available thing to plug-and-play\
* For powering the robot, I'm using: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1002"}}{\fldrslt http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1002}} and for recharging: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2260"}}{\fldrslt http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2260}}\
